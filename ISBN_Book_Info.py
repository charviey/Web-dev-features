# Q1) Assume we have a function get_book_info(isbn) that takes a string ISBN argument and
# retrieves an object containing the Title, Author, and Language of a book (each represented as a string) that
# takes a nontrivial amount of time to run (perhaps because itâ€™s making a call to a database). Write a
# wrapper function that increases performance by keeping results in memory for the quick lookup. To prevent
# memory from growing unbounded, we only want to store a maximum of N book records. At any given time,
# we should be storing the N books that we accessed most recently. Assume that N can be a large number
# when choosing data structure(s) and algorithm(s).
